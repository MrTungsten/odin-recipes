Pre-write: This is my first project for learning HTML basics in the Odin Project. This project is mainly about creating a bare-bones website displaying a variety of recipes.
The website will include links to different pages with their own recipes along with images and lists attached. This will involve paragraphs, both unordered and ordered lists, images, and links.
By the end of this project I hope to be proficient in using HTML to build basic website structure.
