Pre-write: This is my first project for learning HTML basics in the Odin Project. This project is mainly about creating a bare-bones website displaying a variety of recipes.
The website will include links to different pages with their own recipes along with images and lists attached. This will involve paragraphs, both unordered and ordered lists, images, and links.
By the end of this project I hope to be proficient in using HTML to build basic website structure.

Post-write: After completing my first HTML project about creating a recipes page, I now have a solid understanding of writing HTML boilerplate, using headers and paragraphs, utilizing both unordered and ordered lists, and utilizing links. In addition, I have learned to make sure that every image has an alt text. Finally I have a better grasp on how to utilize relative links when linking between pages or accessing local image files. I believe that I have gained the necessary HTML foundations to continue with CSS and Javascript.
